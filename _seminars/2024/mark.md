  This talk will cover two recent projects: In the first half I will discuss solid knitting, a new fabrication method which we recently proposed for making dense, volumetric objects from stacked layers of knit fabric, and will give an overview of the solid knitting machine which we built to automate the process. The layer-by-layer approach of solid knitting is inspired by 3D printing, but because they layers are held together purely by the topological stitch structure---without requiring any sort of adhesive---solid knit objects can easily be unraveled to recover their constituent yarn. In the second half, I will discuss Harnack tracing, a new ray tracing method for visualizing level sets of harmonic functions. Harmonic functions appear ubiquitously in applications from surface reconstruction to architectural geometry, but usually cannot be visualized directly using existing techniques. I will show how our method can be used to visualize smooth surfaces directly from point clouds (via Poisson surface reconstruction) or polygon soup (via generalized winding numbers) without linear solves or mesh extraction, to visualize nonplanar polygons (possibly with holes), surfaces from architectural geometry, and key mathematical objects including knots, links, spherical harmonics, and Riemann surfaces.
