  Curved crease origami transforms flat materials, like paper, into intricate three-dimensional structures by folding along curves. While this discipline is primarily driven by aesthetic exploration, the resulting shapes hold significant practical potential for creating functional, deployable structures that are cost-effective to manufacture. In this talk, I will discuss how the aesthetic qualities of curved crease origami inspire research into developable surfaces and their isometric deformations. Additionally, I will showcase examples of design software that enable the digital fabrication of these complex forms, facilitating their interdisciplinary exploration.
