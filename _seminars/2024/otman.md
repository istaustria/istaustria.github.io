  Our world is bound by unbreakable physical laws that dictate all our interactions within it: from how we perceive touch, to how we plan and build large-scale infrastructure projects.  A fully interactive, physically accurate virtual world would not only allow us to reproduce these interactions cheaply and efficiently, it also allows for the possibility of breaking these laws, widening the scope of what humans can design, build and create. This promises foundational changes in artistic, scientific and engineering disciplines, and has been a long-standing scientific goal since the invention of the first computer displays.<br/>
  Unfortunately, the road to physical models for virtual interaction is paved with contradictions.<br/>
  The model needs to be fast enough for interaction, but also accurate enough to model the complexity of various real-world phenomena. The model needs to be realistic enough to inform real-world decisions, while also allowing for non-physical user-interactions which are a central appeal of virtual environments.<br/>
  Throughout this talk I will outline research Iâ€™ve done through my PhD so far, which traverses the treacherous path to interactive virtual physical worlds. In particular I target virtual worlds driven primarily by soft-body physics, which are traditionally neglected in standard fast physics simulation engines. I will show various avenues we can bring reliable soft-body physics to the real-world regime,  while also providing design and control interfaces for such soft-body physical worlds.
