  Many tasks in computer graphics, including fluid animation, are typically addressed by discretizing the entire domain and solving large, globally coupled systems. The successes of pointwise Monte Carlo methods in rendering and geometry processing raise the question: can Monte Carlo methods also benefit physics-based simulations?<br/>
  In this talk, I will present my research aimed at answering this question. Over the past few years, I have developed Monte Carlo fluid simulation methods using vorticity- and velocity-based formulations. A significant part of this research includes advancements in Monte Carlo PDE solvers. These new methods offer flexibility in using substep solvers and can handle complex boundaries without relying on a cut-cell or conforming mesh discretization that traditional approaches require. I will also discuss insights into how our methods relate to existing techniques in computer graphics and conclude by highlighting several open research directions.
