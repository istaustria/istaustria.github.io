abstract: |
  In the world of interactive computer graphics— spanning video games, virtual reality training, and more— physics simulation plays a fundamental role. However, achieving high-quality, responsive simulations in this context comes with a set of complex technical hurdles. This talk delves into the pursuit of simulations that are not just fast and responsive, but also how the richness of real-time simulations can be ameliorated without sacrificing performance and with minimal changes to existing simulation pipelines. I will explore some of our recent advancements on improving the stability of constrained rigid body simulations, a mainstay of interactive graphics, and additionally showcase new developments on enhancing realism, including advanced friction models, impact and collision responses, and more!
