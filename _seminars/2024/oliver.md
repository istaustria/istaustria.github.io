  Consider an electrically conducting fluid (i.e., a plasma) that is initially at rest. If we allow the fluid to relax to a minimum energy state subject to the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, can we understand the relaxation process or predict the relaxed state? In this talk, inspired by this so-called "magnetic relaxation problem," we explore surprising connections between ideal MHD and conformal geometry, geodesibility of vector fields as well as optimal transport. We also discuss a novel numerical approach to the relaxation of discrete plasma filaments that emerges from these insights.
