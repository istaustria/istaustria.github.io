  The Laplace Beltrami operator is one of the essential tools in geometric processing. It allows us to solve numerous partial differential equations on discrete surface meshes, which is a fundamental building block in many computer graphics applications. However, discrete Laplacians are typically limited to standard elements like triangles or quadrilaterals, which severely constrains the tessellation of the mesh. This talk presents an easy yet efficient strategy to generalize the Laplace Beltrami and its closely related gradient and divergence operators to more general meshes. Furthermore, we discuss how minimizing the trace affects the spectrum of the polygon Laplacian and how to use this information to improve the operator's robustness and accuracy.
