  "The Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition—splitting vector fields or differential forms into exact, coexact, and harmonic components—is a foundational result in differential geometry.  It has many applications in computer graphics, especially for geometry processing and physics-based simulation. Its role in fluid simulation is particularly important, as incompressible flow is governed by divergence-free fields. What is less well known is the boundary-aware version of the theorem: the Morrey–Friedrichs decomposition, which refines the classical result into five components. I will present our work showing why these decompositions are crucial for accurately modeling fluids on domains with nontrivial topology and boundaries, and even on non-orientable surfaces, as well as elucidate the associated physical laws. I will also briefly introduce the DeTurck–Gluck seven-component refinement and some of our related ongoing research."
