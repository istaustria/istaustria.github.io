  In this talk, I will present our group's recent progress in developing particle methods for simulating complex fluid phenomena. I will focus on introducing particle-based data structures and numerical PDE solvers for modeling complex fluid processes characterized by intricate interfacial dynamics, thin-film topology, and vortical structures. I will discuss the roles of particles as interface trackers, differential stencils, and flow-map samplers, enabling the development of effective fluid simulators beyond conventional Eulerian and Lagrangian discretizations. The applications of these methods span a broad range of fluid systems, including surface-tension phenomena, bubbles and foam, particle-laden flows, solid-fluid interactions, and turbulent fluids.
