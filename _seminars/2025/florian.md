abstract: |
  Architecture is fundamentally a multidisciplinary discipline, as Vitruvius rightly noted when listing the ten sciences every architect should master. At the top of his list were Geometry and Arithmetic principles that have since evolved into Computer Science, Euclidian and Non-Euclidian Geometry, and Discrete Geometry. Together, they empower us to push the boundaries of spatial and formal expression and minimize energy consumption, material use, and waste.

  In this talk, I will showcase my latest research at the intersection of computational design and digital fabrication. Topics include robotic string art, robotic 3D printing of free-form concrete panels, cold bending of glass, curvature-adaptive CNC machining, and novel interactive design tools for designing with developable surfaces. From advanced simulations and optimizations to machine learning as a substitute for traditional finite element simulations, novel results open up new possibilities for solving complex design problems and efficient materialization.
