abstract: |
  Practical problems from computer graphics, computer vision, and computational engineering reveal surprising connections to the physics of crystals, knot theory, minimal surfaces, and algebraic geometry. These mathematical tools help us devise more robust and efficient algorithms. Conversely, computational exploration with these tools can provide mathematical insight and elucidate new theoretical questions. Taking inspiration from applications in neural surface representation and computational meshing, I will lay out a path forward in interdisciplinary applied geometry.
