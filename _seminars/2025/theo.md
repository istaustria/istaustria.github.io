  "Discrete Exterior Calculus has become a standard tool for computations on meshes, yet it remains mostly limited to scalar-valued forms. Many geometric and physical systems, however, involve bundle-valued forms together with a connection, for which no widely adopted discrete framework exists.This talk will introduce a discrete analogue of the exterior covariant derivative that extends DEC to forms with values in a vector bundle. We will explore the geometric ideas behind the construction, the role of local frame fields in numerical evaluation, and how the resulting operator preserves key structural properties such as Bianchi identities while converging —in contrast to previous approaches— to its smooth counterpart under refinement."
