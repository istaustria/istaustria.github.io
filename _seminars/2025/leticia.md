abstract: |
  Myriad applications, such as geometric modeling and probabilistic resampling, benefit from algorithms to solve nonlinear or nonconvex PDE-based problems. In this talk, I will describe recent efforts with collaborators in which we developed algorithms that tackle nonlinearity and nonconvexity in this setting. In each of these cases, I will demonstrate how the mathematical properties of the problem, such as viscosity or symmetry, can be exploited to design more robust or fast algorithms for a variety of applications in graphics and vision.
