  Implicit geometry representations such as currents, signed distance functions (SDFs), and more are widely used to represent curved surfaces in computer graphics. While powerful and flexible, these representations often lack key properties of 2D manifolds, such as local parameterization and even integrability. This talk will present approaches for encouraging implicit representations to behave more surface-like, without converting them to meshes and therefore preserving their implicit strengths. We will discuss the geometric notion of what it means to be a 2D manifold, analyze how different implicit representations fall short of this ideal, and discuss optimization schemes that promote surface-like structure. Finally, we will consider the connection between these representations through the lens of geometric measure theory.
