  Nature provides countless examples of network materials exhibiting exceptional flexibility, strength, and durabilityâ€”from the acto-myosin networks within our cells, to the trabecular architectures in our bones, to the intricate venation patterns on insect wings. Recent advances in 3D printing technology now enable us to digitally fabricate engineered network materials whose precisely designed structures and compositions begin to rival these biological counterparts in performance. In this talk, I will present several computational models developed during my PhD for simulating and designing nonlinear elastic networks and beyond. At a high level, I will explore how to model 3D-printed elastic networks with tailored channel geometries that mimic real fabrics, how to efficiently simulate geodesic curves on triangle meshes, and how to design structured nonlinear metamaterials with neural constitutive models. On the technical ground, I will discuss techniques for restoring C2 continuity essential for second-order minimization problems, demonstrate the use of variational formulations combined with implicit function theory to efficiently compute complex second-order derivatives, and explain how implicit neural representations can facilitate gradient-based inverse design.
