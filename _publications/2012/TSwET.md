abstract: |
  We present a method for recovering a temporally coherent, deforming triangle
  mesh with arbitrarily changing topology from an incoherent sequence of static
  closed surfaces. We solve this problem using the surface geometry alone,
  without any prior information like surface templates or velocity fields.
  Our system combines a proven strategy for triangle mesh improvement, a
  robust multi-resolution non-rigid registration routine, and a reliable
  technique for changing surface mesh topology. We also introduce a novel
  topological constraint enforcement algorithm to ensure that the output
  and input always have similar topology. We apply our technique to a
  series of diverse input data from video reconstructions, physics
  simulations, and artistic morphs. The structured output of our algorithm
  allows us to efficiently track information like colors and displacement
  maps, recover velocity information, and solve PDEs on the mesh as a post
  process.

    Our method recovers a sequence of high-quality, temporally coherent triangle
    meshes from any sequence of closed surfaces with arbitrarily changing topology.
    We reliably extract correspondences from a level set and track textures
    backwards through a fluid simulation.
