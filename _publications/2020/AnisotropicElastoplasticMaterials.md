abstract: |
  This paper introduces a simple method for simulating highly anisotropic elastoplastic material behaviors like the dissolution of fibrous phenomena (splintering wood, shredding bales of hay) and materials composed of large numbers of irregularly-shaped bodies (piles of twigs, pencils, or cards). We introduce a simple transformation of the anisotropic problem into an equivalent isotropic one, and we solve this new ``fictitious'' isotropic problem using an existing simulator based on the material point method. Our approach results in minimal changes to existing simulators, and it allows us to re-use popular isotropic plasticity models like the Drucker-Prager yield criterion instead of inventing new anisotropic plasticity models for every phenomenon we wish to simulate.
