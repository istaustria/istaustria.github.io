abstract: |
  Sharing information between multiple tasks enables algorithms
  to achieve good generalization performance even
  from small amounts of training data. However, in a realistic
  scenario of multi-task learning not all tasks are equally related
  to each other, hence it could be advantageous to transfer
  information only between the most related tasks.
  In this work we propose an approach that processes multiple
  tasks in a sequence with sharing between subsequent
  tasks instead of solving all tasks jointly. Subsequently, we
  address the question of curriculum learning of tasks, i.e.
  finding the best order of tasks to be learned. Our approach
  is based on a generalization bound criterion for choosing
  the task order that optimizes the average expected classi-
  fication performance over all tasks. Our experimental results
  show that learning multiple related tasks sequentially
  can be more effective than learning them jointly, the order
  in which tasks are being solved affects the overall performance,
  and that our model is able to automatically discover
  a favourable order of tasks.
