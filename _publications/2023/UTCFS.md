abstract: |
  We present a rigid body animation technique which prevents solids from interpenetrating, dissipates energy through friction, and propagates shocks through contacts. We employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to couple non-smooth Coulomb friction with impact propagation, allowing efficient and accurate non-smooth dynamics along with a correct transmission of impacts through assemblies of rigid bodies. We further extend our method to model adhesion, dynamic friction and lubricated contact.
