abstract: |
  Physics simulation in computer graphics can bring triangle meshes into topologically invalid states. The method in this thesis contributed to [Multi-Material Mesh-Based Surface Tracking with Implicit Topology Changes](/publications/2024/SDTF/), which presents a non-manifold hybrid surface trackerâ€”a surface tracker that repairs explicit non-manifold triangle meshes with the help of the implicit domain. Specifically, this thesis provides an algorithm for filling the holes that are left after removing problematic parts of the mesh.
