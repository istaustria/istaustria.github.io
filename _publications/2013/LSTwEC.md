abstract: |
  Our work concerns the combination of an Eulerian liquid simulation with a
  high-resolution surface tracker (e.g. the level set method or a Lagrangian
  triangle mesh). The naive application of a high-resolution surface
  tracker to a low-resolution velocity field can produce many visually disturbing
  physical and topological artifacts that limit their use in practice. We address
  these problems by defining an error function which compares the current state
  of the surface tracker to the set of physically valid surface states. By
  reducing this error with a gradient descent technique, we introduce a novel
  physics-based surface fairing method. Similarly, by treating this error
  function as a potential energy, we derive a new surface correction force that
  mimics the vortex sheet equations. We demonstrate our results with both level
  set and mesh-based surface trackers.

    Our method permits high-resolution tracking of a low-resolution fluid
    simulation. Due to the resolution mismatch, the original simulation (top)
    exhibits both surface noise in the form of wrinkles and banding, and
    topological noise in the form of holes and gashes. Our method removes such
    unphysical features while preserving desirable physically-consistent details
    through strategically places surface waves (bottom). The right shows a
    close-up of the bottom right corner of the simulation.
