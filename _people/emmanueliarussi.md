bio:
  I've recently got my Ph.D. at [GRAPHDECO](https://team.inria.fr/graphdeco/) team, [Inria Sophia Antipolis](http://www.inria.fr/centre/sophia/), France. In 2012 I've graduated as a Systems Engineer from [UNICEN University](http://www.unicen.edu.ar/), Tandil, Argentina. I'm a former member of [ANR DRAO Project](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/drao/index.html), focused on facilitating and accelerating drawing for amateurs, expert designers and illustrators. As a researcher, I'm mostly interested in imaging, fabrication and graphics as well as human-computer interaction techniques for image creation and manipulation.
